        It was found that even households generate hazardous waste,from items
        such as batteries,used computer equipment, and leftover paints or pesticides.
        Toxic waste can harm people,animals, and plants, whether it ends up in the 
        ground, in streams,or even in the air.

    <h3 class="headings">About Waste Management Awareness</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Waste management awareness encompasses a multifaceted approach 
      aimed at educating individuals, communities, and businesses about 
      the importance of proper waste disposal and resource conservation. 
      It involves raising awareness about the environmental impacts of waste 
      generation and the benefits of waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. 
      Through education and outreach initiatives such as workshops, seminars, 
      and awareness campaigns, people are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices 
      like source reduction, reuse, and repurposing of materials. Providing convenient 
      recycling facilities and programs, promoting waste separation and collection, 
      and supporting innovative waste management technologies are essential components 
      of waste management awareness efforts. Additionally, advocating for comprehensive 
      waste management policies and regulations, along with enforcement measures, 
      helps to deter environmentally harmful practices and ensure compliance. 
      Ultimately, by promoting waste management awareness and fostering a culture 
      of sustainability, we can mitigate environmental pollution, conserve natural 
      resources, and create a healthier planet for current and future generations.

    <h3 class="headings">About Recycling process</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Recycling in waste management involves diverting waste materials from landfills 
      by repurposing them into new products or materials. It's part of a broader waste 
      management strategy that also includes reducing waste generation and reusing 
      materials whenever possible. Recycling helps conserve natural resources, reduces 
      energy consumption, and minimizes environmental impacts associated with waste 
      disposal. Effective recycling programs often involve community participation, 
      proper collection and sorting of recyclables, and partnerships with recycling 
      facilities for processing.
